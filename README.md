# QuakeReport
Example of Codable to read a JSON feed

This is a very simple example of using structs that conform to Codable to read JSON data using https from a data source.  In this case the source is the USGS earthquake data.

There are a lot of improvements that could be made to this code, but I have refrained from doing them so that you can see the basic code without a lot of extra code to make it look more complicated than it realy is. For example, you could add an activity spinner to show that the data is loading. You could add the ability to pull down the list to refresh it. You could auto-refresh periodically. All these things would make the app better, but also make it more complicated.

Of course, if you use this code, you are responsible for it and should not base any life decisions based on the data presented.
